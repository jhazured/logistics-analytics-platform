  customer_id VARCHAR
) RETURNS BOOLEAN ->
  CASE 
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'DATA_ENGINEER' THEN TRUE
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'DATA_ANALYST' AND

           SELECT customer_id FROM user_customer_access 
           WHERE user_id = CURRENT_USER()
         ) THEN TRUE
    ELSE FALSE
  END;

-- Apply to customer table
ALTER TABLE tbl_dim_customer ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY customer_data_policy ON (customer_id);
```

### Data Masking

CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS (
  email VARCHAR
) RETURNS VARCHAR ->
  CASE 
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'DATA_ENGINEER' THEN email
    ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(email, '(.*)@(.*)', '***@\\2')
  END;

-- Apply masking policy
ALTER TABLE tbl_dim_customer MODIFY COLUMN contact_email 
SET MASKING POLICY email_mask;
```

### Audit Logging

Comprehensive data access and modification tracking:

```sql
-- Create audit log table
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  event_id VARCHAR,
  event_type VARCHAR,
  table_name VARCHAR,
  user_name VARCHAR,
  role_name VARCHAR,
  query_text VARCHAR,

ORDER BY usage_date DESC;
```

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Configuration

### Warehouse Optimization

Environment-specific warehouse configurations:

```sql
-- Development warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_DEV
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Development warehouse for dbt runs';

-- Staging warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_STAGING
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Staging warehouse for testing';

-- Production warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_PROD
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Production warehouse for dbt runs';
```

### Resource Monitors

Cost control and resource management:

```sql
-- Daily cost monitor
CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR daily_cost_monitor
  CREDIT_QUOTA = 100
  FREQUENCY = DAILY
  START_TIMESTAMP = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
  TRIGGERS
    ON 80 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
    ON 90 PERCENT DO SUSPEND
    ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE;

-- Assign to warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_PROD SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = daily_cost_monitor;
```

### Clustering Keys

Optimize query performance with clustering:

```sql
-- Cluster fact tables by date
ALTER TABLE tbl_fact_shipments CLUSTER BY (shipment_date);

-- Cluster dimension tables by key
ALTER TABLE tbl_dim_customer CLUSTER BY (customer_id);

-- Cluster ML feature tables by feature date and customer
ALTER TABLE tbl_ml_consolidated_feature_store CLUSTER BY (feature_date, customer_id);
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Scalability Features

### Auto-scaling

Dynamic resource allocation based on demand:

```sql
-- Multi-cluster warehouse for high concurrency
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_MULTI
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 10
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD'
  COMMENT = 'Multi-cluster warehouse for high concurrency';
```

### Partitioning

Optimize large table performance:

```sql
-- Partition large tables by date
CREATE TABLE tbl_fact_shipments_partitioned (
  shipment_id VARCHAR,
  shipment_date DATE,
  customer_id VARCHAR,
  -- other columns
) CLUSTER BY (shipment_date);

-- Use date-based partitioning for time-series data
CREATE TABLE tbl_ml_features_partitioned (
  feature_id VARCHAR,
  feature_date DATE,
  customer_id VARCHAR,
  -- other columns
) CLUSTER BY (feature_date, customer_id);
```

### Caching

Intelligent result caching for performance:

```sql
-- Enable result caching
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;

-- Create materialized views for frequently accessed data
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_customer_summary AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_tier,
  COUNT(*) as total_shipments,
  AVG(delivery_time_hours) as avg_delivery_time,
  SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
FROM tbl_fact_shipments
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_tier;

-- Auto-refresh materialized view
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_customer_summary SET AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE;
```

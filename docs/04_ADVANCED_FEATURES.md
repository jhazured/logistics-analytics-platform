CREATE STREAM shipment_stream ON TABLE tbl_fact_shipments;
CREATE STREAM vehicle_stream ON TABLE tbl_dim_vehicle;

-- Create tasks for real-time processing
CREATE TASK update_customer_segments
  WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH_XS
  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 */5 * * * UTC'
AS
  MERGE INTO tbl_ml_customer_behavior_segments t
  USING (
    SELECT 
      customer_id,
      customer_tier,
      order_frequency_30d,
      CASE 
        WHEN order_frequency_30d > 10 THEN 'HIGH_FREQUENCY'
        WHEN order_frequency_30d > 5 THEN 'MEDIUM_FREQUENCY'
        ELSE 'LOW_FREQUENCY'
      END as behavior_segment
    FROM customer_stream
    WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT' OR METADATA$ACTION = 'UPDATE'
  ) s ON t.customer_id = s.customer_id
  WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET
    behavior_segment = s.behavior_segment,
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (
    customer_id, behavior_segment, created_at, updated_at

## 🔒 Security & Governance

### Row-Level Security

Implement customer and vehicle data protection:

```sql
-- Customer data protection
CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY customer_data_policy AS (
  customer_id VARCHAR
) RETURNS BOOLEAN ->
  CASE 
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'DATA_ENGINEER' THEN TRUE
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'DATA_ANALYST' AND 
         customer_id IN (
           SELECT customer_id FROM user_customer_access 
           WHERE user_id = CURRENT_USER()
         ) THEN TRUE
    ELSE FALSE
  END;

-- Apply to customer table
ALTER TABLE tbl_dim_customer ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY customer_data_policy ON (customer_id);
```

### Data Masking

Protect sensitive information with dynamic masking:

```sql
-- Mask customer email addresses
CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS (
  email VARCHAR
) RETURNS VARCHAR ->
  CASE 
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'DATA_ENGINEER' THEN email
    ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(email, '(.*)@(.*)', '***@\\2')
  END;

-- Apply masking policy
ALTER TABLE tbl_dim_customer MODIFY COLUMN contact_email 
SET MASKING POLICY email_mask;
```

### Audit Logging

Comprehensive data access and modification tracking:

```sql
-- Create audit log table
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  event_id VARCHAR,
  event_type VARCHAR,
  table_name VARCHAR,
  user_name VARCHAR,
  role_name VARCHAR,
  query_text VARCHAR,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP_NTZ
);

-- Enable query logging
ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG = 'AUDIT_QUERY';
```

## 📊 Advanced Analytics

### Rolling Time Windows

Advanced time-series analysis with multiple rolling windows:

```sql
-- 7-day rolling metrics
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  AVG(delivery_time_hours) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY shipment_date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) as avg_delivery_time_7d,
  
  -- 30-day rolling metrics
  AVG(delivery_time_hours) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY shipment_date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) as avg_delivery_time_30d,
  
  -- 90-day rolling metrics
  AVG(delivery_time_hours) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY shipment_date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 89 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) as avg_delivery_time_90d
FROM tbl_fact_shipments;
```

### Trend Analysis

Calculate trends and seasonality patterns:

```sql
-- Delivery time trends
WITH delivery_trends AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('week', shipment_date) as week,
    AVG(delivery_time_hours) as avg_delivery_time,
    LAG(AVG(delivery_time_hours), 1) OVER (ORDER BY week) as prev_week_avg
  FROM tbl_fact_shipments
  GROUP BY week
)
SELECT 
  week,
  avg_delivery_time,
  prev_week_avg,
  (avg_delivery_time - prev_week_avg) / prev_week_avg * 100 as week_over_week_change_pct
FROM delivery_trends;
```

### Predictive Analytics

Advanced predictive features for ML models:

```sql
-- Predictive maintenance features
SELECT 
  vehicle_id,
  current_mileage,
  days_since_last_maintenance,
  maintenance_interval_miles,
  
  -- Risk scoring
  CASE 
    WHEN days_since_last_maintenance > maintenance_interval_miles * 0.9 THEN 'HIGH'
    WHEN days_since_last_maintenance > maintenance_interval_miles * 0.7 THEN 'MEDIUM'
    ELSE 'LOW'
  END as maintenance_risk_level,
  
  -- Predicted maintenance date
  DATEADD(day, 
    (maintenance_interval_miles - (current_mileage - last_maintenance_mileage)) / 
    (current_mileage / DATEDIFF(day, last_maintenance_date, CURRENT_DATE())),
    CURRENT_DATE()
  ) as predicted_maintenance_date
FROM tbl_dim_vehicle;
```

FROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY warehouse_name, usage_date
ORDER BY usage_date DESC;
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Warehouse Optimization

Environment-specific warehouse configurations:

```sql
-- Development warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_DEV
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Development warehouse for dbt runs';

-- Staging warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_STAGING
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Staging warehouse for testing';

-- Production warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_PROD
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
  COMMENT = 'Production warehouse for dbt runs';
```

### Resource Monitors

Cost control and resource management:

```sql
-- Daily cost monitor
CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR daily_cost_monitor
  CREDIT_QUOTA = 100
  FREQUENCY = DAILY
  START_TIMESTAMP = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
  TRIGGERS
    ON 80 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
    ON 90 PERCENT DO SUSPEND
    ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE;

-- Assign to warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_PROD SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = daily_cost_monitor;
```

### Clustering Keys

Optimize query performance with clustering:

```sql
-- Cluster fact tables by date
ALTER TABLE tbl_fact_shipments CLUSTER BY (shipment_date);

-- Cluster dimension tables by key
ALTER TABLE tbl_dim_customer CLUSTER BY (customer_id);

-- Cluster ML feature tables by feature date and customer
ALTER TABLE tbl_ml_consolidated_feature_store CLUSTER BY (feature_date, customer_id);
```

## 📈 Scalability Features

### Auto-scaling

Dynamic resource allocation based on demand:

```sql
-- Multi-cluster warehouse for high concurrency
CREATE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH_MULTI
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 10
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD'
  COMMENT = 'Multi-cluster warehouse for high concurrency';
```

### Partitioning

Optimize large table performance:

```sql
-- Partition large tables by date
CREATE TABLE tbl_fact_shipments_partitioned (
  shipment_id VARCHAR,
  shipment_date DATE,
  customer_id VARCHAR,
  -- other columns
) CLUSTER BY (shipment_date);

-- Use date-based partitioning for time-series data
CREATE TABLE tbl_ml_features_partitioned (
  feature_id VARCHAR,
  feature_date DATE,
  customer_id VARCHAR,
  -- other columns
) CLUSTER BY (feature_date, customer_id);
```

### Caching

Intelligent result caching for performance:

```sql
-- Enable result caching
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;

-- Create materialized views for frequently accessed data
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_customer_summary AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_tier,
  COUNT(*) as total_shipments,
  AVG(delivery_time_hours) as avg_delivery_time,
  SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
FROM tbl_fact_shipments
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_tier;

-- Auto-refresh materialized view
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_customer_summary SET AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE;
```

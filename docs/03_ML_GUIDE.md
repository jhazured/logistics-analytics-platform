## ðŸš€ Quick Start for ML Engineers

### **1. Access ML Features**

The platform provides a centralized feature store with 50+ engineered features:

```sql
-- Access consolidated feature store
SELECT * FROM tbl_ml_consolidated_feature_store 
WHERE feature_date = CURRENT_DATE();

-- Customer features for segmentation
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_tier_numeric,
    customer_tenure_days,
    customer_on_time_rate_30d,
    customer_reliability_tier
FROM tbl_ml_consolidated_feature_store
WHERE feature_type = 'customer';

-- Vehicle features for predictive maintenance
SELECT 
    vehicle_id,
    vehicle_age_years,
    current_mileage,
    days_since_last_maintenance,
    maintenance_risk_score
FROM tbl_ml_consolidated_feature_store
WHERE feature_type = 'vehicle';
```

### **2. Model Training**

Use the feature store for model training with proper train/validation/test splits:

```python
import snowflake.connector
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Connect to Snowflake
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user='your_user',
    password='your_password',
    account='your_account',
    warehouse='COMPUTE_WH_MEDIUM',
    database='LOGISTICS_DW_PROD',
    schema='ML_FEATURES'
)

# Load training data
query = """
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_tier_numeric,
    customer_tenure_days,
    customer_on_time_rate_30d,
    customer_reliability_tier,
    -- Add more features as needed
FROM tbl_ml_consolidated_feature_store
WHERE feature_date >= DATEADD(day, -90, CURRENT_DATE())
  AND feature_date < CURRENT_DATE()
"""

df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Prepare features and target
X = df.drop(['customer_id', 'target_column'], axis=1)
y = df['target_column']

# Train/validation split
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
val_score = model.score(X_val, y_val)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {val_score:.3f}")
```

### **3. Model Registry**

Register and track your models in the ML model registry:

```sql
-- Register new model
INSERT INTO tbl_ml_model_registry (
    model_id,
    model_name,
    model_version,
    model_type,
    training_data_source,
    feature_columns,
    model_metrics,
    model_artifact_path,
    created_by,
    created_at
) VALUES (
    'cust_seg_v1.0',
    'Customer Segmentation Model',
    '1.0',
    'classification',
    'tbl_ml_consolidated_feature_store',
    ARRAY_CONSTRUCT('customer_tier_numeric', 'customer_tenure_days', 'customer_on_time_rate_30d'),
    PARSE_JSON('{"accuracy": 0.85, "precision": 0.82, "recall": 0.88}'),
    's3://ml-models/customer_segmentation_v1.0.pkl',
    'ml_engineer@company.com',
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
);

-- Track model performance
INSERT INTO tbl_ml_model_performance (
    model_id,
    evaluation_date,
    accuracy,
    precision,
    recall,
    f1_score,
    data_drift_score
) VALUES (
    'cust_seg_v1.0',
    CURRENT_DATE(),
    0.85,
    0.82,
    0.88,
    0.85,
    0.12
);
```

### **4. Real-time Inference**

Deploy models for real-time inference using the feature serving views:

```sql
-- Real-time customer features for inference
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_tier_numeric,
    customer_tenure_days,
    customer_on_time_rate_30d,
    customer_reliability_tier,
    risk_score
FROM vw_ml_real_time_customer_features
WHERE customer_id = 'CUST_12345';

-- Real-time vehicle features for predictive maintenance
SELECT 
    vehicle_id,
    vehicle_age_years,
    current_mileage,
    days_since_last_maintenance,
    maintenance_risk_score,
    predicted_maintenance_date
